# The Nymph
A Rain World mod by Tyxaar

*The Nymph is a small and agile thing, but possesses vastly inferior strength. Use your agility and strange powers to traverse this world.*

Press jump while in the air to activate a glide that lasts for 1 second. Landing on the ground resets the timer on this.

You are smaller than most slugcats and hit 3/4 as strong as the Survivour, but you throw much faster.
However, you are very nimble, being able to run fast and jump high.


## Installation and Dependencies
Extract the zip and add the DLL into your BepInEx mods folder!
**You need the most recent version of Slugbase**

## Credits
Nymph coding and art by Tyxaar, with art fixes by Dragoler.

Immense thanks to Slime_Cubed for the slugbase framework, and all the help he's given to me over development. In extension, I'd like to thank the Rain World modding community for their help in this. I couldn't have done it without him or the others.
