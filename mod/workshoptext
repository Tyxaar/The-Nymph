[h1]The Nymph, a frail but agile slugcat.[/h1]

[i]Play as a new character, The Nymph! Small and nimble, with a focus on outmaneuvering your enemies, your journey will be perilous, and you must utilise your agility and strange power to survive in this world meant for beings far stronger than you.[/i]

Immense thanks to Slime_Cubed for the SlugBase framework, and all the help he's given me. I'd like to extend that thanks to the RW modding community in general, if anyone's reading this, you know who you are! Coding and art by me, with art help by the lovely Dragoler. :D

Note that this mod IS a work in progress, and I have lots of plans to expand on it, including an art update and proper campaign with multiple new and reworked regions! However I'm currently studying Architecture at uni so my time to work on Nymph is limited. I hope you all have fun with this mod though!

[b]Nymph features:[/b]
[hr][/hr][list]
[*] Nymph is a small slugcat, looking like a pup to most!
[*] You're agile and quick, with a focus on aerial mobility.
[*] The Third primal urge is baked deep into the nymph's soul... you start with 3 max karma.
[*] You can use your strange abilities to perform an aerial leap, followed by a glide. Sparks start to emerge when your gliding time is low.
[*] A strict carnivore, The Nymph gets more sustenance from most meats but cannot eat plant matter.
[*] Resourceful and wary, you can carry a spear on your back.
