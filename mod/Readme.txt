-----------------------------------------
A Rain World mod by Tyxaar

*The Nymph is a small and agile thing, but possesses vastly inferior strength. Use your agility and strange powers to traverse this world.*

Mechanics
-----------------------------------------
1) Press jump while in the air to activate an aerial leap and short glide that lasts for 1 second. Landing on the ground resets the timer on this.
2) You are smaller than most slugcats and hit 1/2 as strong as the Survivour, but you throw much faster.
3) You are also very nimble, being able to run fast and jump high. This can get you places that you normally can't.
4) You need 6 food to hibernate, but can only store 1 for later.
5) Rivulet's world is used! Pebbles is just normal with survivour dilogue for now, don't report this as a bug! I'm working on it.
8) You start in Sky Islands at the top of the communications array. Why? Well we'll find that out later.
9) You CANNOT leap/glide while holding a grapple worm. Don't report this as a bug! It's there to avoid wacky physics. Just drop the worm and the glide's re-enabled.
6) You're a strict carnivore, and unable to eat plants. However you gain more sustenence from meat than usual!

Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------------------
Addd the attached zip into your mods folder and extract it for manual downloads, then run the game! The Nymph should show up on your character select screen after enabling the mod in Remix.
You need the most recent version of Slugbase. Please don't come to me with bugs if you don't have it.

Immense thanks to Slime_Cubed for the slugbase framework, and all the help he's given to me over development. In extension, I'd like to thank the Rain World modding community for their help in this. I couldn't have done it without him or the others.
