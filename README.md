_Small and nimble, with a focus on outmaneuvering your enemies, your journey will be perilous, and you must utilise your strange powers to survive in this world meant for beings far stronger than you. It also doesn't help that your uncanny agility requires a large amount of food to function._

Immense thanks to Slime_Cubed for the SlugBase framework, and all the help he's given me. I'd like to extend that thanks to the RW modding community in general, if anyone's reading this, you know who you are.

Coding and art by me, with art help- by the lovely Dragoler.

Mechanics
-----------------------------------------
1) Press jump while in the air to activate a short glide that lasts for about a second. Sparks appear when you activate it as well as when your time is running out. Press jump during this glide to disable it.

2) If you hold grab while jumping in the air, you get an aerial leap! Be careful though, as 4 uses of this will drain a food pip.

3) You are smaller than most slugcats and hit 1/2 as strong as the Survivour, but you throw much faster.

4) You are also very nimble, being able to run fast and jump high, although your advanced movement on the ground is limited. This aerial focus can get you places that you normally can't.

5) You need 6 food to hibernate, and can only store 1 for later.

6) Rivulet's world is used! Pebbles is just normal with survivour dilogue for now, don't report this as a bug! It should be changed in a future update.

7) You start in Sky Islands at the top of the communications array. Why? Well we'll find that out later.

8) You CANNOT leap/glide while holding a grapple worm. Don't report this as a bug! It's there to avoid wacky physics. Just drop the worm and the glide's re-enabled.

9) You're a strict carnivore, and unable to eat plants.

10) The Nymph is strongly tied to the third primal urge... I'm afriad that for now at least, you cannot ascend beyond it without help. 

Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------------------
Add the attached zip into your mods folder and extract it for manual downloads, then run the game! The Nymph should show up on your character select screen after enabling the mod in Remix.
You need the most recent version of Slugbase. Please don't come to me with bugs if you don't have it.
